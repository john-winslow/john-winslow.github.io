	<p>Sadly, there are few website dedicated to displaying the glrious versatility of head ware.  However, I did find <a href="http://www.evilchili.com/blogs/235/A_Guide_to_the_Awful_Types_of_Hats">this</a> blog post detailing the more terrible variations available.  The page leaves much to be desired, mainly due to the images not displaying.  <strong><em>Any</em></strong> website about funny hats should definitely make sure that the images are displaying correctly.</p>
